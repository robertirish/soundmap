Hello, and welcome to Sound-map! This is a project by New York-based recordist Robert Irish (me), logging my experiences capturing soundscapes around the world. The main purpose of making these recordings is to document the unique environments I come across, and to archive them in my libraryâ€”they might end up being used in music or other projects in future, but for now I am setting out to capture them without any further goal in mind.
