sound-map.org is a project by New York-based recordist Robert Irish (me), logging my experiences capturing soundscapes around the world, with a focus on natural environments and the ambience of gallery and museum interiors. The purpose of making these recordings is to document and archiveâ€”they might end up being used in music or other projects down the track but for now I'm setting out to capture them without any further goal in mind.

### Acknowledgements

All of the equipment and techniques I use to capture audio I have read about on sound blogs all over the web, but the sites I find myself visiting regularly are [Mindful Audio](https://mindful-audio.com), [The View Up Here](https://tombenedict.wordpress.com/) and [Creative Field Recording](https://www.creativefieldrecording.com/).

The map portion of this site was inspired by Colin Hunter's [World Sounds](https://world-sounds.org). It is based on the excellent [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) by Volodymyr Agafonkin.

sound-map.org is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), compiled by and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). I use a modified version of the [Forever Jekyll](https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll) theme.
