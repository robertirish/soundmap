sound-map.org is an archive project logging my experiences capturing soundscapes around the world. The purpose of making these recordings is to document the places I come acrossâ€”they might end up being used in music or other works down the track but for now I'm setting out to capture them without any further goal in mind.

### Acknowledgements

The equipment and techniques I use to capture audio I have read about on sound blogs all over the web, but the sites I find myself visiting regularly are [Mindful Audio](https://mindful-audio.com), [The View Up Here](https://tombenedict.wordpress.com/), [Wav.Report](https://wavreport.com/) and [Creative Field Recording](https://www.creativefieldrecording.com/).

The map portion of this site was inspired by Colin Hunter's incredible [World Sounds](https://world-sounds.org). It is based on [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) by Volodymyr Agafonkin.

sound-map.org is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). It uses a modified version of the [Forever Jekyll](https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll) theme.
