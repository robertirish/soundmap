title: Field report—Tivoli Bays wetlands, take II
categories: [field report, tivoli bays, wetlands]

A couple of days ago I went back to the Tivoli Bays wetlands to try and capture the night ambience there after my first attempt didn’t go as planned. <!--more-->I took the same compact drop rig (Sony M10, MicBooster Clippys with wind protection) and set up a stereo array, securing a microphone to either side of a thick walkway post.

Picking up the kit following morning, I was relieved to find that the M10 was still recording (going on 12 hours on two AAs!), but I noticed that the left channel was showing a much lower signal level than the right on the meters. On reviewing the audio back at home, I saw that the left microphone, starting about 5 hours into the recording, slowly faded out to next to zero signal, and then came back in very slowly. This happened several and seemingly at random, over the following hours. I’m not sure whether to attribute this to a faulty microphone capsule or the humidity of the environment. I’m leaning towards the latter as there is no static or crackling type sounds, and after a couple of days in storage with a desiccant packet the microphone seems to be working properly again. That said my faith in this set of Clippys isn’t great, and I’d hesitate to  use them again in a one-off recording opportunity.

This left me with about 5 hours of good audio to listen through. The Clippy + M10 combo worked well, though will require a significant bass rolloff as there is a lot of low end rumble. I’m not sure what caused this (maybe vibration transferring through the post the mics were mounted to?), or if it’s just to do with the frequency response of the capsules. I’d prefer it if no post-processing were necessary, but it’s an easy fix and the resulting audio is pleasing to my ears with a good stereo image.

There are some interesting parts in the recording, with frogs “barking” intermittently to the left and right of the rig and at different distances away. What I think might be a large bird shakes out its wings (or perhaps a deer shaking its ears of flies and mosquitoes), and there are different splashes and water sounds, some from fish breaking the surface of the river and others from larger animals moving through the water. There are a couple of large splashes and the snapping of twigs behind the microphones in the surrounding forest, which might make for a more lively soundscape than the wetlands.

The insect chorus is ever-present, and sadly for my purposes so are the sounds of distant car and motorcycle engines that crop up every minute or so. I inadvertently captured some good train-bys (there must be a freight line passing through the reservoir), and these are probably the best, or at least the most representative, parts the recording. If I’m lucky I’ll get a few clean minutes of the wildlife chorus, but I think the outcome is positive regardless—I’ve learned a little more about my equipment, captured some sounds I wasn’t expecting to hear, and generated some more ideas for my future drop rigs.

			<dd>Left channel microphone faded in and out very slowly and at random, starting about 5 hours into the recording—possibly due to humidity/moisture. Recorder was still running strong on two AAs when I picked it up. Good stereo image using tree ears setup. Noise pollution from motor vehicle engines every minute or so. Inadvertently captured some freight train-bys which might make for the best recordings from this excursion.</dd>
