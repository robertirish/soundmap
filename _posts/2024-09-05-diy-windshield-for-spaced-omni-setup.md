title: DIY windshield for spaced omni setup

I spent some time browsing the web for wind protection solutions for my Sennheiser MKH8020 microphones. I own the [Cinela ALBERT](https://www.cinela.fr/albert/ "Cinela ALBERT windshield") which works well for ORTF, but I wanted something more flexible that would allow me to record using spaced omnis and other mic arrays. <!--more-->While ultimately I'd like to get a pair of [Cinela LEO windscreen balls](https://www.cinela.fr/leonard/ "Cinela LEO windscreen balls") (which would require some slight adjustment to fit the 19mm MKH8000 series mics regardless), I needed something cheap, and after coming across [this great step-by-step guide](https://saralana.xyz/windscreen "DIY windscreen with o-ball: A simple tutorial to do a windscreen for your microphone (⌀ 20mm), step by step") I decided to try making my own.

My solution is based on the design by [Sara Lana](https://saralana.xyz/ "The website of Sara Lana") and [Felix Blume](https://felixblume.com/ "The website of Felix Blume") outlined in the article linked above, with a different mechanism for mounting the microphone. Where Lana’s design uses a moldable glue to fasten a rubber microphone shockmount to the Oball, I found a large rubber grommet that fits neatly into one of the spaces in the sphere. I needed to pad out the 22mm inside diameter of the grommet to get a tight fit around the 8020s, so I experimented with cutting down some rubber shockmount sleeves. Once I landed on the right size, I used a drop of superglue to secure the pieces to the inside of the grommets inserted into the Oballs.

Next I cut the toes off a pair of tights which I stretched over the assemblies, leaving them a little long so that an elastic band can be used to secure the material at the base of the microphones. This should provide some transparent protection from light wind. For more extreme conditions I can add a pair of [Rycote Windjammers](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/322367-REG/Rycote_021801_Windjammer_for_Baby_Ball.html "Rycote BBG Windjammer at B&H Photo Video") I bought secondhand from B&H some time ago and haven't had a use for until now.

And that's it! These can be used when I want an ORTF solution that is a more compact than the ALBERT by using a stereo bar like [the one made by RODE](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1383781-REG/rode_sb20_stereo_bar_high_quality_stereo_bar_for.html "RODE Stereo Bar at B&H Photo Video") pictured above, or the mics can be mounted individually on [Joby GorillaPods](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1359598-REG/joby_jb01511_gorillapod_1k_stand.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A6879&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwreW2BhBhEiwAavLwfHAhWe-kvr94CYskSWGoNCfRBhPhztamKimbQuxkjajUnS3cNGzN4RoCBx4QAvD_BwE "Joby GorillaPod 1K Flexible Mini-Tripod at B&H Photo Video") for a spaced setup.

If you want to try making your own, here is a list with links to the materials I used, all purchased from Amazon with the exception of the Rycote Windjammers (which could be DIY'd as suggested in Sara Lana's guide, linked at the top of this page). The total cost to make two units was about $40 (all prices listed here are in USD, as of 2024-09-05).
