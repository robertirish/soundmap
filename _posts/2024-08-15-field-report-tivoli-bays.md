This evening after putting our baby down and just before losing the light, I drove in to Tivoli Bays, a ~1,500-acre wildlife reserve not far from our house here in upstate New York. I took a small recording setup (a drop rig based on those detailed by [George Vlad](https://mindfulaudio.com)) consisting of a Sony PCM-M10 recorder, a stereo pair of [MicBooster Clippys](https://micbooster.com/clippy-and-pluggy-microphones/98-295-clippy-stereo-em272-microphone.html#/84-plug_type-right_angle/203-microphone-em272z1), and some small [Windbubble](https://www.bubblebeeindustries.com/products/the-twin-windbubbles-2-per-package?variant=28407557123) fluffies, and attached the mics to a post on the walkway before putting the recorder in a dry bag and coming home. I positioned the rig on the underside of a wide hand railing so as to provide some additional protection from rain.

Unfortunately I didn't capture a full nights audio as I had hoped, because I hadn't put a microSD card in the recorder and so was limited to the 4GB internal memory of the M10. The resulting recording is crisp with a good stereo wideness (thanks to the "tree ear" type setup) but isn't serviceable as there is noise pollution from the surrounding area. Given I only captured the couple of hours between 8 and 10:30PM or so, my hope is that at around 2 or 3:00AM there will be less of this and that I can capture a clean soundscape, if only for a few minutes out of 12+ hours.

Luckily for me Tivoli Bays is only a short distance away and I can go back to capture the ambience for a second time. Better to make this mistake now than at a location that is less easily accessible. Very frustrating nonetheless!

			<dd>Gain was set too hot and some clipping occurred, aim for -12dB peaks in future. Clear recording through the M10/Clippy combo, good stereo image. Not a lot of interesting wildlife at this time in this location—soundscape dominated by chorus of insects. Failed to install  memory card in M10 and only captured ~2 hours of audio on the 4GB of built-in memory.</dd>
