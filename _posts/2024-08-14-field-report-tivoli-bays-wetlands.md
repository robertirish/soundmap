title: Field report—Tivoli Bays wetlands

This evening after putting our baby down and just before losing the light, I drove in to Tivoli Bays, a ~1,500-acre wildlife reserve not far from our home here in upstate New York. <!--more-->I took a small recording setup (a drop rig like those used by [George Vlad](https://mindful-audio.com)) consisting of a Sony PCM-M10 recorder, [MicBooster Clippy](https://micbooster.com/clippy-and-pluggy-microphones/98-295-clippy-stereo-em272-microphone.html#/84-plug_type-right_angle/203-microphone-em272z1) microphones and some [Windbubbles](https://www.bubblebeeindustries.com/products/the-twin-windbubbles-2-per-package?variant=28407557123). After finding a spot that sounded interesting, I positioned the mics on the underside of a wide hand railing to provide some protection from rain, put the M10 in a dry bag and hit record.

I didn't capture a full nights audio because I forgot to put a microSD card in the recorder and so was limited to the 4GB internal memory of the M10. Even so the resulting recording is crisp with a good stereo wideness (I used a tree ears setup), but there is a lot of noise pollution from the surrounding area. Given I only captured the couple of hours between 8 and 10 p.m., my hope is that later at night there will be less of this and that I can capture a clean soundscape.

Luckily Tivoli Bays is only a short distance away and I can go back to record the ambience for a second time. Better to make this mistake now than at a location that is less easily accessible. Very frustrating nonetheless!

				<dd>Forgot memory card in M10 and only captured ~2 hours of audio. Gain was set too hot and some clipping occurred, aim for -12dB peak level in future. Clear recording through the Sony M10/Clippy combo with pleasing stereo image. Not a lot of interesting wildlife at this time in this location—soundscape dominated by chorus of insects.</dd>
