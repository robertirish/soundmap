title: Field report—Tivoli Bays wetlands... take III!
categories: [field report]

I decided to make a third attempt to capture the ambience of the Tivoli Bays wetlands. <!--more-->I learned from my first two tries that locating the microphones out in the open, close to the riverbank, allowed noise from trains and motor vehicle engines to reach them over a long distance. With that in mind, I positioned them a little way back from the river in the surrounding forest, with the hope that the trees and foliage would help isolate them from these unwanted sounds. It did help to some degree, particularly in the higher frequency range, but there is still a low rumble present that I can only attribute to the nearby train line.

The drop rig I used on this session was a Zoom F3 recorder coupled with a stereo pair of DPA 4060 microphones. I wanted to try this setup for a couple of reasons. Firstly, to see if the low-end noise I had captured in my previous sessions was coming from the microphones (it wasn’t); and secondly, because it was raining when I set up the rig and the DPAs have better resistance to moisture than the EM272 electret capsules. I attached the mics to small branches underneath a fallen tree to provide them with some protection from the rain. They did get quite wet (there was a heavy downpour not long after I left), but continued to capture audio without a hitch—a nice surprise after having the Clippys drop out intermittently.

I was able to set up this rig much more quickly as I can control the F3 recorder using the Zoom smartphone app. This meant I could prepare my kit beforehand and all I needed to do on site was to choose a position for the mics—once they were in place, I could adjust levels and hit record without needing to remove the recorder from the bag. This is a big plus when working in the rain or in situations when pressed for time. The downside is that it doesn’t allow for monitoring of the signal coming in, as the F3 doesn’t transmit audio through bluetooth. This could be worked around using a small wireless transmitter attached to the line out of the recorder, but will need some experimenting with to find a setup that works reliably.

So again, I’ve captured a couple of nice (rainy) train-bys, but not the clear recording of the wetlands wildlife I was after. For now I think I’ll move on and try some different locations to see what kind of results I get, and to see if I encounter the same problems elsewhere.
