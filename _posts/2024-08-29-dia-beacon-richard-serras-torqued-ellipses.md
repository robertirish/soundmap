A couple of weeks ago I drove my family an hour south to Beacon, NY. We went to visit a [great toy store](https://www.erikabarratt.com/brickandmortar), see some friends who live there, and to visit the [Dia Art Foundation](https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/dia-beacon-beacon-united-states).<!--more-->

I first visited the Dia on a trip to the US in 2012, and have thought about it often since then. It must have illuminated something for me because I enrolled in a post-graduate art course at the University of New South Wales the following year!

It was the Dia that introduced me to the work of Agnes Martin, Louise Bourgeois and, amongst many others, Richard Serra (who passed away earlier this year). Serra’s monoliths are undeniable within the already-striking architecture of the gallery, which often commands more comment from Madelaine and myself than the minimalistic work it holds inside it. One large rusted-steel Serra sculpture occupies a room almost completely so that visitors are forced to squeeze past it between, hugging the gallery walls.

The Torqued Ellipses are housed in a cavernous warehouse-type room with high ceilings and plenty of space to move around them, and the feeling of these works is different—welcoming in contrast to the others’ impenetrability. Serra invites us inside the high walls through openings and maze-like passages, to the center of the ellipses where we are privy to a world seen through the lens of the work. The ceiling of the room is framed by the sweeping arcs of steel; sound is altered by the strange acoustics of these spaces, with the footsteps of strangers seeming to emanate from inside one’s own skull, and conversations in other languages echo and collide, alien yet familiar in their intonations and rhythms.

I had had the idea to record the ambience inside the Torqued Ellipses before we went made the trip south, so I was prepared with my microphones and recorder. My mics (DPA 4060s) were clipped to either side of a black shoulder bag in order to be inconspicuous, and I was able to capture some interesting moments (though my time was limited, as this wasn’t a dedicated field recording trip!). I’m looking forward to going back when I have more time to listen to the works and be more intentional with my mic positioning, and maybe using a LOM Geophone (if I can get my hands on one) to record the singing of the sculptures themselves. Hopefully soon I'll have a change to edit and upload some of the recordings I made.

I find more to love in these works, and at the Dia, with each visit I make. With luck it will be a place I return to regularly over the course of my life.
