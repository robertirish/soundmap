A couple of weeks ago I drove my family an hour south to Beacon, NY. We planned to visit a [great toy store](https://www.erikabarratt.com/brickandmortar), see some friends who live there, and to visit the [Dia Art Foundation](https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/dia-beacon-beacon-united-states).<!--more-->

I first visited the Dia on a trip to the US in 2012, and have thought about it often since then. It must have illuminated something for me because I enrolled in a post-graduate art degree the following year!

It was the Dia that introduced me to the work of Agnes Martin, Louise Bourgeois and, amongst many others, Richard Serra, who passed away earlier this year. Serra’s monoliths are undeniable within the already-striking architecture of the gallery, which I find often commands more comment than the minimalistic work it holds inside it. One large rusted-steel Serra sculpture occupies a room so completely that visitors are forced to squeeze past it, almost hugging the gallery walls.

The Torqued Ellipses are housed in a cavernous warehouse-type room with plenty of space to move around them, and the feeling of these works is different—welcoming in contrast to the others’ impenetrability. Serra invites us inside the high walls through openings and maze-like passages, to the center of the ellipses, where we are privy to a world seen through the lens of the work itself. The ceiling of the hall is sliced and framed by sweeping arcs of steel; sound is altered by the strange acoustics of the internal spaces, with the footsteps of strangers seeming to originate inside your own skull, whilst sneakers shriek and conversations held in different languages echo and collide, familiar only in their intonations and rhythms.

I had had the idea to record the ambience inside the Torqued Ellipses before we made the trip, so I was prepared with my microphones and recorder. My mics (DPA 4060s) were clipped to either side of a black shoulder bag in order to remain inconspicuous, and I was able to capture some interesting moments though my time was limited, as this wasn’t a dedicated field recording trip. Hopefully soon I'll have a chance to edit and upload some of the recordings I captured.

I’m looking forward to going back when I can listen to the works over a longer period and be more intentional with my mic positioning, and maybe use a LOM Geophone (if I can get my hands on one) to record the singing of the sculptures themselves. I find more to love in these works, and at the Dia, with each visit I make. With luck it will be a place I return to regularly over the course of my life.
